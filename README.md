Stock Price Prediction using LSTM
## Overview
This project involves developing a stock price prediction model using advanced deep learning techniques, particularly Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, to forecast future stock prices. The model is designed to predict the stock price for the next four months and evaluate its accuracy using various performance metrics.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing data, feature scaling, and time series transformation.
- **Deep Learning Model**: Implemented LSTM for time series forecasting to predict stock prices.
- **Ensemble Methods**: Utilized stacking and boosting techniques to improve prediction accuracy.
- **Feature Engineering**: Integrated technical indicators and alternative data sources for enhanced predictions.
- **Model Evaluation**: Conducted backtesting with walk-forward optimization and evaluated performance using MAE, MSE, and R-squared metrics.
- **Visualization**: Plotted actual vs predicted stock prices, including future predictions.
